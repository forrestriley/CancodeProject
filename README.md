# CancodeProject

Lee's Feedback

Hi team, 

Overall this is a very nice project. I like how the code is laid out. It is clean, easy to read and follow and the theme is the same across all pages. 

Some things I noticed that could be improved. Make sure that your syntax is clean and finalized. There are some missing semicolons in the CSS. This does not cause the pages to load incorrectly but is something that should be uniform across all pages, and will help avoid future problems. Also, the About page does not have much on it and does not follow the same design with the nav bar as the other pages. Also the Contact us page looks good but is not fully styled out to fit a similar theme as the rest of the pages. Overall, good work and great job in class! 

Thank you!!

Lee
